The goal of this project is to create a primitive database management system based on relational algebra. We are to develop the basic management system engine code, develop a parser to interpret commands that are to be fed into the engine, then later create an application for the system as well as fine tune the parser and engine. 
Management systems are essential to solve many of today’s problems, and the project’s goal is to show us the fine tunings on how such an engine works by creating a basic example. Through this assignment, not only do we get to know the depth of such an advanced piece of software, but we adopt the skills of working with other coders on the same project and the management involved in it. 
As far as the database management engine goes itself, there are several concepts that we have to adopt such as the design and functionality of the engine, the grammar of the system to interpret and parse inputs to allow the essential functions that any end-use of a database management system would need, and the application itself which handles the user’s input and output. After fulfilling these requirements, we should have a basic database management system fully functioning.
