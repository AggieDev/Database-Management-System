you'll see that the definition for literal is "intentionally left unspecified" on the webpage, I propose:


   literal ::= "(identifier)" | integer


(it's either an identifier in quotes or its an integer) 
I'm basing this off of the insert-cmd structure:


   insert-cmd ::= INSERT INTO relation-name VALUES FROM ( literal { , literal } )


that is used like this:


   INSERT INTO friends VALUES FROM ("X", "N/A", "Awesome!", 100);
