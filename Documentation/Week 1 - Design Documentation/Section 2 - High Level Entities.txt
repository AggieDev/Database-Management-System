High Level Entities - Description (from bottom to top)


Database: a static class (only one instance is allowed) to store all Tables for our pet store in a vector.

Table: Represents a collection of files (.txt, .csv, .xml,…) that each identify a relation table. A table can identify attributes for a specific entity and/or relationships between many entities.


Data Manipulation Language (DML): Language to respond to database queries. These consist of: open, close, write, exit, show, create table, insert into, update, delete, select, project, +, -, and *. More generally, the implemented functions   (for which a CLI will be provided) will allow us to update the database for long-term usage.

 - As mentioned above, a command line interface (CLI) will be provided to make the DML function calls to the database

 - A parser will be implemented for our domain-specific DML for our queries

 - The domain for our database will also be defined 


DB Application: written in c++ to interact with the DML and provide the user with a way to use the database. This application can provide the user with direct access to the stored data and/or integrate the data to the back-end for a more complex application

 - a CLI will be an easy implementation to use the functionality of the DB 

 - a GUI will be a more difficult implementation that will result in a more user-friendly experience
